While I graduated from UMass Amherst with a degree in Computer Science, I don't feel as if I learned how to write new stuff that works in the real world. Instead, I learned how to fill in the blanks of premade projects. So I'm starting over from scratch and with learning how to code "stuff that works in the real world."
