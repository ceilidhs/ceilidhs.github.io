  <h1>How to Make Mushroom Stroganoff</h1>
  <p>This is one of my favorite recipes.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>10 oz. Wide/extra wide egg noodles</li>
    <li>4-5 large portobella mushrooms</li>
    <li>2 TBSP butter</li>
    <li>1 TSP salt</li>
    <li>10 scallions or ½ medium "sweet" onion</li>
    <li>1 TBSP all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>½ cup dry wine</li>
    <li>8 oz broth/stock</li>
    <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
    <li>4 oz goat cheese</li>
    <li>½ tsp ground black pepper</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Melt half of the butter in a 10-inch straight-sided saute pan over high heat.</li>
    <li>Add half of the mushrooms and sprinkle with ½ teaspoon of salt. Saute for 5 to 6 minutes, until the mushrooms darken and reduce in volume by half. Remove to a bowl.</li>
    <li>Repeat with the remaining butter, the remaining mushrooms and the remaining teaspoon salt, along with the white bottoms of the scallions or onion.</li>
    <li>Return all the mushrooms to the pan, sprinkle in the flour and stir to combine, cooking for 1 minute, or until the flour disappears and a dark “fond” appears on the bottom of the pan.</li>
    <li>Deglaze the pan with the vegetable broth and wine, and as soon as it simmers (almost immediately), decrease the heat to low and cook for 10 to 12 minutes to reduce the liquid. While the sauce reduces, cook the egg noodles according to package instructions.</li>
    <li>Add the sour cream, goat cheese and pepper to the sauce and stir to combine. Bring to a bare simmer and cook, covered, for 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
    <li>Drain the noodles and stir gently into the mushroom mixture. Turn onto a platter and garnish with the scallion tops and additional pepper.</li>
  </ol>
